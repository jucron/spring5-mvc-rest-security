# Spring Framework 5 MVC Rest Application - JWT SECURITY

This is the same project based on the spring5-mvc-rest Application (from my repository), but with the implementation of a JWT Token security layer.

Check the Swagger Api Documentation: [Live Server Test](https://mvc-rest-security.herokuapp.com/)
Please NOTE: Swagger documentation will return 'Forbidden 403' response, since fetching Data is limited by security.

It is more properly to Test using the Postman with Authorization Header:
[Postman api-rest-security Workspace](https://go.postman.co/workspace/My-Workspace~b20ca6f3-aa32-48c5-8c9c-bb8dc06af4dd/collection/18570764-335e581f-b4ff-4667-a0e8-d4f2b15456c9)
